# Contributing to VisionSync

Thank you for your interest in contributing to VisionSync! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Vision and Goals

VisionSync aims to be a state-of-the-art framework for vision-enabled automation and learning systems. Our key principles are:

- Dynamic Learning: Systems that grow and adapt through experience
- Vision Integration: Seamless incorporation of visual processing and understanding
- Extensible Architecture: Easy to extend and customize for specific use cases
- Robust and Reliable: Production-ready code with comprehensive testing

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/visionsync/core.git
cd visionsync
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e ".[dev]"  # Install development dependencies
```

```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes, following our coding standards:
- Use type hints
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Add docstrings for all public functions/classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Write tests for new functionality
- Include vision processing considerations where relevant

3. Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest
```

4. Run code quality checks:
```bash
# Type checking
mypy core systems

# Code formatting
black core systems tests
isort core systems tests

# Linting
flake8 core systems tests
pylint core systems tests
```

5. Commit your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description of your changes"
```

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `docs:` for documentation updates
- `test:` for test updates
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks
- `vision:` for vision-specific enhancements

6. Push your changes and create a pull request:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 90%
- Use pytest fixtures for test setup
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and error cases
- Include vision processing test cases where applicable

### Test Structure

```python
def test_function_name():
    """Test description."""
    # Arrange
    # Set up test data and dependencies
    
    # Act
    # Execute the function being tested
    
    # Assert
    # Verify the results
```

## Vision System Guidelines

When implementing vision-related features:

1. Support common image formats and sources
2. Handle different resolutions and color spaces
3. Consider performance implications
4. Implement proper error handling for vision-specific issues
5. Add appropriate logging for vision processing steps
6. Include vision-specific configuration options

Example vision system implementation:
```python
class VisionSystem(EnhancementSystem):
    """Vision processing and analysis system."""
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def process_image(self, image_data: bytes) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Process image data and extract information."""
        pass
```

## Code Review Process

1. All changes must be submitted via pull request
2. CI checks must pass
3. Code review by at least one maintainer required
4. All comments must be resolved
5. Changes must be up to date with main branch
6. Vision-related changes require additional review focus

## Enhancement Systems

When implementing new enhancement systems:

1. Create an interface in `systems/base.py`
2. Implement the system in a new file under `systems/`
3. Add configuration in `core/config.py`
4. Add tests under `tests/systems/`
5. Update documentation
6. Consider vision system integration points

## Documentation

- Keep README.md up to date
- Add docstrings to all public APIs
- Update CHANGELOG.md for all notable changes
- Include examples for new features
- Document configuration options
- Provide vision processing examples and guidelines

## Release Process

1. Update version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create release PR
4. After merge, create GitHub release
5. CI will automatically:
   - Run tests
   - Build package
   - Push to PyPI
   - Build and push Docker image

## Getting Help

- Create an issue for bugs
- Discuss major changes in issues first
- Join our Discord for questions
- Check existing documentation and issues
- Use vision-specific tags for vision-related questions
