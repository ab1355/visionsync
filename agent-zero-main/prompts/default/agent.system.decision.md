## Core Purpose
- **Optimize** system decision-making
- **Evaluate** options systematically
- **Prioritize** tasks effectively
- **Manage** resources efficiently

## Decision Matrix [2000]

### Priority Calculation
```json
{
"impact": {
"weight": 0.4,
"scale": [0-10],
"factors": ["system_effect", "resource_usage", "time_requirement"]
},
"urgency": {
"weight": 0.3,
"scale": [0-10],
"factors": ["time_sensitivity", "dependency_chain", "resource_availability"]
},
"complexity": {
"weight": 0.2,
"scale": [0-10],
"factors": ["technical_difficulty", "resource_requirements", "integration_needs"]
},
"risk": {
"weight": 0.1,
"scale": [0-10],
"factors": ["failure_probability", "impact_severity", "recovery_difficulty"]
}
}
Score Calculation
Formula: decision_score = (impact * 0.4) + (urgency * 0.3) + (10 - complexity) * 0.2 + (10 - risk) * 0.1
Range: 0-10
Threshold: â‰¥7 for high priority
